Greener is the second game of the GreenGreenerGreenest set. Green, Greener and Greenest are three games that use the same set of components.

Greener is a capturing game for 2 players, where both must capture the same colour.

Depending on the set, you’d have:

Basic: a 6×6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.

Gameplay overview:

The board starts full of pyramids. Players take turns capturing pyramids or stacks of any colour orthogonally.

The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the most green pyramids captured (being part of stacks they control) wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest stack wins. If the tie persists, play again.
